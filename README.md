# Banker's Algorithm in C 🖥️💻

## Overview 🌟

Welcome to the **Banker's Algorithm in C** – a classic deadlock avoidance algorithm used to allocate resources to processes safely. This algorithm ensures that your system is always in a **safe state** by checking if resource requests can be granted without causing a deadlock. Think of it as your **system’s bodyguard** protecting you from those pesky deadlocks! 💪

## Files 📂

- **bankersalgorithm.c**: The C code that implements the Banker's Algorithm (the brain behind the operation!).
- **README.md**: You're reading it right now.

## Input Description 🔑

You'll be asked to provide the following:

1. **Number of Resources (`r`)**: Total different types of resources.
2. **Number of Processes (`p`)**: How many processes are chilling in the system.
3. **Allocated Resources (`allocres`)**: The resources already allocated to each process.
4. **Maximum Resources (`maxres`)**: The maximum number of resources each process may need.
5. **Available Resources (`availres`)**: Resources currently available in the system.

The program computes **needed resources (`needres`)** based on this formula:

```
needres[i][j] = maxres[i][j] - allocres[i][j]
```

Where `i` is the process and `j` is the resource type.

## Output 🚀

The program will give you one of two possible outcomes:

1. **Safe State (yasss! ✅)**:
   ```
   System is in a safe state.
   Safe sequence: <processes>
   ```

2. **Not Safe (uh-oh! 🛑)**:
   ```
   System is not in a safe state
   ```

It also gives you a **safe sequence** of processes if everything checks out.

## How to Run 🚀

1. **Install a C Compiler** (GCC or any C IDE).
2. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   gcc bankersalgorithm.c -o bankersalgorithm
   ```
3. **Run it**:
   ```bash
   ./bankersalgorithm
   ```

4. **Input your data** when prompted:
   - Number of resources.
   - Number of processes.
   - Allocated resources.
   - Maximum resources.
   - Available resources.

## Example 🧑‍💻

**Sample Input:**

```
Enter the number of resources
3
Enter the number of processes
5
Enter the allocated resources
Enter allocated resources for process 1
0 1 0
Enter allocated resources for process 2
2 0 0
Enter allocated resources for process 3
3 3 2
Enter allocated resources for process 4
2 1 1
Enter allocated resources for process 5
0 0 2
Enter the maximum resources
Enter maximum resources for process 1
7 5 3
Enter maximum resources for process 2
3 2 2
Enter maximum resources for process 3
9 0 2
Enter maximum resources for process 4
4 3 3
Enter maximum resources for process 5
5 3 3
Enter the available resource
3 3 2
```

**Sample Output:**

```
The needed resources
7 4 3
1 2 2
6 0 0
2 2 2
5 3 1
System is in a safe state.
Safe sequence: 1 3 4 2 5
```

## Function Breakdown 🛠️

### `issafe`

This function checks if the system is in a safe state or not by simulating the allocation process and finding a safe sequence of processes.

- **Inputs**:
  - `allocres[10][10]`: Allocated resources for each process.
  - `availres[10]`: Available resources.
  - `maxres[10][10]`: Maximum resources needed by each process.
  - `needres[10][10]`: Resources needed by each process to finish.
  - `r`: Number of resources.
  - `p`: Number of processes.

- **Output**: Returns `true` if the system is in a safe state and prints the safe sequence. Returns `false` if the system is not in a safe state.

### `main`

The entry point. It takes your input, processes it, and calls `issafe` to check if the system is safe.
